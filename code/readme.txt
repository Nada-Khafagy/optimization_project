go to optimization_project\code
run main.py

Randomized sequences is  printed
Accepted sequences after feasibility check is printed
opjective function for the accepted sequences are printed
and Finally, the best solution for the SA is saved and printed
 :) 

to do list :
-change how ramp looks in visualtion
- change intial positin ramp to the first car on ramp (rest of the cars are already randomized based on value of first cars)
- make ditance to lead dynamic
- mqake visualzation start from zero and sraet platooning from decsision point 
- choose what to do if no main line cars in solution (reject?)
