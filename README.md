# optimization_project
optimization of the merging of vehicles on ramps
## Instructions
- go to optimization_project\code
- run intialize.py

we have implemented platooning and you can see the map of the car in the initlization file
but the evaluation of the objective function is yet to be done and it is in the main.py file
enjoy looking at the vehicles of the main line on the map :)
